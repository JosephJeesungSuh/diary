    "Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?",
    "Tell me about anyone else in your life we haven’t discussed (like friends or romantic partners). Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?",
    "Now let’s talk about your current neighborhood. Tell me all about the neighborhood and area in which you are living now.",
    "Tell me about any recent changes to your daily routine.",
    "How would you describe your political views?",
    "How have you been thinking about race in the U.S. recently?",
    "How have you been thinking about gun rights in the U.S.?",
    "For you, what makes it easy or hard to stay healthy?",
    "Some people say they struggle with depression, anxiety, or something else like that. How about for you?"
